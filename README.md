# Foundation for WordPress
A blank WordPress theme with Foundation CSS

## Details
This theme will serve as a starting point and is meant for you to add your own custom css to design it further. Placing Foundation CSS directly in a completely blank WordPress theme was the only build process.
You view the <a href="https://foundationforwp.com/using-foundation-css-wordpress-theme/">How to Use</a> for an overview of theme build, however, if you're already with familiar with the Foundation CSS framework along with WordPress, you're probably good to just install the theme and go.

## License
I make a good amount of $ from using this theme as a starting point for my clients because how quick I can build from it. Please feel free to do the same on your commercial/personal projects - no credit needed and the theme is easily white-labled (no naming conventions in code).
