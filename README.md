# Foundation for WordPress
<a href="https://foundationforwp.com/using-foundation-css-wordpress-theme/">https://foundationforwp.com</a> - A blank WordPress theme with Foundation CSS

## Details
This theme will serve as a starting point and is meant for you to add your own custom css to design it further. Placing Foundation CSS directly in a completely blank WordPress theme was the only build process.
You can view the <a href="https://foundationforwp.com/using-foundation-css-wordpress-theme/">How to Use</a> page for an overview of the theme (layouts, preloaded functions, etc...), however, if you're already with familiar with the Foundation CSS framework along with WordPress, you're probably good to just install the theme and go.

## License
I make a good amount of $ from using this theme as a starting point for my clients because how quick I can build from it. Please feel free to do the same on your commercial/personal projects - no credit needed and the theme is easily white-labled (no naming conventions in code).
